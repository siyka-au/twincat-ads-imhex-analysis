# TwinCAT ADS ImHex Analysis
The purpose of this project is to decode undocumented Beckhoff TwinCAT ADS data types and data streams.
Current work is on decoding the MQTT binary data streams sent by TwinCAT Analytics DataLogger when using
MQTT Binary protocol as I do not wish to use their tools for data storage or dissection.
